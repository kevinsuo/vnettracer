# vNetTracer
vNetTracer is a network tracing system, which enables flexible and programmable network performance monitoring for virtualized networks in a highly efficient manner. vNetTracer traces the packets at user defined tracepoints through eBPF programs, which can be executed, modified and deleted at runtime. vNetTracer decomposes and attributes network performance to various components inside the virtualized network, which can help monitor network performance, locate bottlenecks, and recognize potential issues.


# Dependency 

You need:

> gcc, python and bcc (https://github.com/iovisor/bcc)

Kernel modification: 

> sender and receiver side: search "by Kun" in the following files:

TCP: 

> include/net/netns/ipv4.h

> net/ipv4/sysctl_net_ipv4.c

> net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c

> net/ipv4/tcp_output.c

UDP: 

> net/ipv4/udp.c


To get TCP header options (default value): 

> $ sudo sysctl -n net.ipv4.tcp_option

0

To enable TCP header options: 

> $ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_option=1





# Usage 

To adopt vNetTracer in your systems, please follow the steps below:

1, Use the template bpf script to write and configure your own tracing scripts.

To configure your tracing:

> modify the files in the config folder based on your tracing purpose, such as IP addresses, ports, etc.

To write your tracing logic:

> modify the script.c file and add your c code inside.

2, Execute the tracing scripts to collect raw tracing data.

> $ python script.py

3, Calculate the raw tracing data and analyze the potential problems.
